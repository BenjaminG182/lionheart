# lionheart

Lionheart is an app that pairs with your Apple Watch and encourages you to get fit! As you complete challenges, you'll be able to customize your superhero!
Each day you will be presented with a challenge. As you complete the challenge, you will receive another item for your superhero to wear!

# to do's 
Phase 1 - The Mobile App
This will be created originally as a mobile app. It will present you with different daily workouts, adjusted by your "workout level." Each workout you complete will give you an item that is randomly selected. You can choose to equip the item or not. 

Phase 2 - The Location
Create your own hero hideout! This will be started by first selecting a background. Then, earn different items/furniture to display. This will be somewhat 2d but animated with js.

Phase 3 - Integrate with Apple Watch
The app will integrate with the Apple Watch and have daily popup reminders (at a time set by the user) of, "Ready for a challenge?" Once accepted, it will begin tracking your fitness through the Apple Fitness app (research API calls available to retrieve information). Once you complete the challenge, something will happen to let you know you have completed the challenge (maybe create a small video to play, similar to how Apple Watch currently gives badges) and to check your app to see which item was earned.
